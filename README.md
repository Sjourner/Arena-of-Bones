Arena of Bones is a single-player, text & turn-based RPG fighting game and a hobby project of - well, mine.

The game is technically a website (developed solely with HTML, CSS, EMAScript [=Javascript] and Jquery) and thus, 
should work without any compatibility issues on any modern browsers and devices.

A few remarks before you embark to explore this project:
- It is the first hobby project of a non-IT person, who uses this to learn the basics of programming.
Hence, the code is a mess and if you'd like to avoid any serious mental hazard - don't check the code.
- Due to the point above, it's full with bugs/half-implemented features. If you stuck one point, simply reload the site
(it is not so complex game yet, you don't miss anything)
- The game uses (a slightly modified) mechanics of the paper-and-pencil game Pathfinder. 
If you are not familiar with this system (or any versions of Dungeons and Dragons), below you can find a quick summary.
	1. At the beginnging of the game you generate characters. Warning: The given distance should be divisible with 5.
	(2. If you entered manually generated characters, you can customize them - because it's fun!)
	3. Start the combat. On the top, the order of the players and enemies are listed in the order of initiative rolls.
	By clicking on any of them, you can get more info about them. 
	4. Every actor can take actions, then must finish their turn (e.g. click on "Execute" at "End Turn"). 
	Everybody can: attack once or run or move twice or move once and attack once. 
	5. You have to approach your enemies to attack them. The number in brackets represents the positon of the characters
	in feets from a point of 0. If the distance from the nearest enemy(es) is equal to 5', this enemy is listed in the
	"Single Attack" list - then you can attack it. 
	6. The game rolls all the values - you'll find the result of your actions in the rectangle below.
	7. Your goal is to reduce the HP value of the enemies before they do the same with your characters'.
  
Well, I hope I covered all the basics - have fun!
